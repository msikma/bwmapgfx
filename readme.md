Contains the **StarCraft: Brood War** map graphics used for generating screenshots of **maps** (.scm, .scx) and **replays** (.rep).

## Usage

```ts
import {getBwGraphicsPath} from '@dada78641/bwmapgfx'
import Chk from 'bw-chk'

const graphicsPath = getBwGraphicsPath() // e.g. "/home/me/MyProject/node_modules/bwmapgfx/resources"

const graphicsObj = Chk.fsFileAccess(graphicsPath)
```
